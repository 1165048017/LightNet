LightNet is a lightweight, versatile and purely Matlab-based deep learning framework. The aim of the design is to provide an easy-to-understand, easy-to-use and efficient computational platform for deep learning research. The implemented framework supports major deep learning architectures such as the Multilayer Perceptron Networks (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). LightNet supports both CPU and GPU for computation and the switch between them is straightforward. Different applications in computer vision, natural language processing and robotics are demonstrated as experiments.

## How to use LightNet

Read the tutorial slides in the Documentations folder.  
Install the latest Matlab (**R2016b or later**) on a computer, and run the RunAll.m Matlab script.  
Have fun!  

## Recent updates

20170801: Second-order SGD is introduced (SGD2), together with the corresponding normalization technique RMSnorm and a new ModU activation function. 
SGD2 is a fast second-order training method (or known as the Newton's method) that trains faster and better, and shows better tolerance to bad initializations. 
Check it out in \SGD2. 

Implicit expansion is adopted to replace the bsxfun in LightNet. As a result, *Matlab R2016b* or later is required.

CUDNN is supported by installing Neural Network Toolbox from Mathworks. The convolutional network training is over 10x faster than the previous release! The current version can process 10,000 CIFAR-10 images per second in the training.

LightNet supports using pretrained ImageNet network models.

## How to accelerate LightNet  

Nvidia CUDNN can be used to calculate convolutions. 

1. You will need to install the Neural Network Toolbox from Mathworks. Make sure you can run it properly. (Ref to our tutorial slides.)  
2. Set opts.use_nntoolbox=1 in the main tesing script.
