LightNet is a lightweight, versatile and purely Matlab-based deep learning framework. The aim of the design is to provide an easy-to-understand, easy-to-use and efficient computational platform for deep learning research. The implemented framework supports major deep learning architectures such as the Multilayer Perceptron Networks (MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). LightNet supports both CPU and GPU for computation and the switch between them is straightforward. Different applications in computer vision, natural language processing and robotics are demonstrated as experiments.

## How to use LightNet

Install the latest Matlab on a computer, and run the RunAll.m Matlab script. The computation can be accelerated by using an Nvidia GPU. And can be further accelerated by installing the Neural Network Toolbox Add-on.

## Recent updates

- ![#f03c15](https://placehold.it/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) CUDNN is supported by installing Neural Network Toolbox from Mathworks. The convolutional network training is over 10x faster than the previous release! The current version can process 10,000 CIFAR-10 images per second in the training.

LightNet supports using pretrained ImageNet network models.

## How to accelerate LightNet

Nvidia CUDNN can be used to calculate convolutions. 

1. You will need to install the Neural Network Toolbox from Mathworks. Make sure you can run it properly. (Ref to the tutorial "Transfer Learning Using Convolutional Neural Networks" in the toolbox.)  
2. Set opts.use_nntoolbox=1 in the main tesing script.
